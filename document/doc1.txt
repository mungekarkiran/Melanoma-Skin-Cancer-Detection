---------------------------------

The preprocessing steps of resizing images to 224×224 pixels and converting them to grayscale offer several advantages that enhance model training. Resizing ensures model compatibility by matching input dimensions to the requirements of pre-trained architectures, while also standardizing dimensions across the dataset to eliminate variability, allowing the model to learn patterns effectively. Additionally, resizing reduces computational load by decreasing the image size, requiring less memory and enabling faster processing while retaining critical features. Similarly, converting images to grayscale reduces dimensionality by transforming three-channel RGB data into a single channel, significantly decreasing computational complexity. This step also focuses on intensity patterns, retaining essential texture and lesion variations for classification, and reduces noise by eliminating unnecessary color information, enabling the model to concentrate on structural and texture-based features. Together, these steps streamline data preparation and enhance the model’s performance and generalizability.
