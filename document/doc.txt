1. Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide, with melanoma being the deadliest subtype due to its aggressive nature and high metastasis potential. Early detection and classification of melanoma significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and patient survival. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have demonstrated the potential to enhance medical image analysis, offering robust solutions for automated disease detection.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the cornerstone for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies. Transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, has emerged as a prominent approach for medical imaging tasks, especially when labeled data is limited. This research focuses on building an automated system that compares the performance of various transfer learning models on raw and preprocessed melanoma skin cancer images to provide insights into optimal methodologies for clinical application.

2. Motivation
The detection and diagnosis of melanoma through dermoscopic images require specialized expertise, often unavailable in low-resource settings. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets or subtle visual variations.

Despite the success of CNN-based models, the choice of preprocessing techniques and model architecture can significantly influence the detection performance. Preprocessing methods, such as noise reduction, segmentation, and masking, aim to emphasize critical image features while suppressing irrelevant information. However, their impact on different transfer learning models is underexplored. By systematically comparing raw and preprocessed images across multiple pre-trained models, this research seeks to address the gap and provide a roadmap for optimizing melanoma detection workflows.

3. Problem Statement
Melanoma is a life-threatening condition that necessitates timely and accurate detection to reduce mortality rates. Current diagnostic techniques heavily rely on dermatologists, making them inaccessible in underdeveloped regions. While deep learning models have shown promise in automating diagnosis, there is a lack of standardized methodologies to compare and evaluate the performance of various transfer learning models on raw and preprocessed images.

The primary challenge lies in determining:
	1. The impact of preprocessing techniques on model performance.
	2. The suitability of different transfer learning models for melanoma classification.
	3. The comparative effectiveness of raw versus preprocessed images in improving detection accuracy.

This research addresses these challenges by performing a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art transfer learning models using raw and preprocessed images for melanoma detection.

4. Methodology
The proposed methodology for this research is divided into the following stages:

4.1 Data Collection
The study utilizes a publicly available melanoma skin cancer dataset containing dermoscopic images classified into two categories: benign and malignant. Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset contains 10000 images. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. Dataset consists of 9600 images for training the model and 1000 images for evaluation of model.

4.2 Image Preprocessing
To evaluate the impact of preprocessing, two image sets are created:

	1. Raw Image Set: Original images without any preprocessing.
	2. Preprocessed Image Set: Images processed using the following techniques:
		- Resized to 256×256 pixels.
		- Converted to grayscale version of the image.
		- Noise reduction using block-matching 3D (BM3D) filtering.
		- Binary mass lesion image and Binary lesion mask formed by thresholding.
		- Segmentation using binary lesion masks and morphological operations.
		- Generation of masked ROI showing only the masked area of the image and inverse-masked images showing everything except the masked area.
		- Canny edge-detected image.

4.3 Transfer Learning Models
The study employs the following pre-trained models for transfer learning:
	1. VGG16
	2. MobileNet
	3. DenseNet
	4. ResNet50
	5. InceptionV3

Each model is fine-tuned on both raw and preprocessed image sets, with the final layers replaced to classify images into benign or malignant categories.

4.4 Model Training and Evaluation
For each image set, the models are trained using the same experimental setup:
	1. Data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
	2. Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss.
	3. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa.

Comparative Analysis, the performance of each model on raw and preprocessed images is compared based on Classification metrics. Graphs and tables are used to illustrate the performance of models. Key insights into the impact of preprocessing and model architecture on melanoma detection accuracy are discussed.





The rapid advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the field of medical image analysis, offering highly accurate and automated solutions for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and anomaly detection. Melanoma detection relies on dermoscopic image analysis, a task characterized by complex patterns, subtle color variations, and irregular shapes. Traditional machine learning models struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their inability to process raw pixel data effectively.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a breakthrough in image classification. CNNs are particularly suited for spatial data due to their hierarchical feature extraction mechanism. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models, reducing the computational cost and the amount of labeled data required for training. Popular architectures like VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 provide a solid foundation for medical imaging tasks by extracting high-level features while preserving local spatial information.

Preprocessing techniques play a critical role in medical imaging, aiming to enhance the image quality and highlight relevant features. Techniques such as noise reduction, segmentation, and masking ensure that models focus on the lesion's characteristics rather than irrelevant background information. The integration of transfer learning with carefully preprocessed images can significantly improve melanoma detection accuracy.

The design methodology involves several systematic steps, each addressing a specific aspect of the melanoma detection process. Below, we outline these steps, their objectives, and the achieved outcomes.

Step 1: Dataset Preparation
Collected a publicly available melanoma dataset with dermoscopic images categorized into benign and malignant classes. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets. Also, ensured the availability of balanced and diverse data for model training, helps to reducing the risk of overfitting.

Step 2: Image Preprocessing
We applied preprocessing techniques to create two distinct image sets. We use original images without modification as raw image set. For the preprocessed image set, Images resized to 224×224, converted to grayscale, denoised using block-matching 3D filtering, segmented into binary lesion masks using maximum entropy thresholding, and enhanced using morphological operations.

The threshold 





Step 3: Model Selection
The selected five state-of-the-art transfer learning architectures: VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. Replaced the final layers of each model to adapt them for binary classification. We achieved the robust feature extraction capabilities of pre-trained models, enabling effective learning from a limited dataset. To enhance model we use eal-time data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustments and Increased the effective dataset size and introduced variability, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Step 4: Training and Fine-Tuning
The training and fine-tuning process for this research involved adapting pre-trained deep learning models — VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 for binary classification of melanoma images into benign and malignant categories. Each model's fully connected layers were replaced with a custom head consisting of a global average pooling layer, a dense layer with ReLU activation, and a final output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification. The models were trained separately on both raw and preprocessed image datasets to evaluate the impact of preprocessing on performance. The Adam optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 10−4, was used to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss. Early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure convergence.

During fine-tuning, the base layers of each model were partially unfrozen to allow the network to adapt pre-trained weights to the specific melanoma dataset while retaining the general features learned during initial training on large datasets such as ImageNet. Data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, zooms, and brightness adjustments were incorporated to increase the diversity of training samples, improving model robustness and generalization. The training process was monitored using validation accuracy and loss metrics, ensuring the selection of the best-performing model for final evaluation. This systematic approach to training and fine-tuning allowed for a comprehensive comparison of model architectures and preprocessing methods, highlighting the most effective strategies for melanoma detection.


Step: Model Evaluation
The evaluation of models in this study was conducted using a comprehensive set of metrics to ensure a robust assessment of their performance. Accuracy and loss were used as primary metrics during training and validation to monitor overall classification performance and the optimization process. Precision and recall, critical for imbalanced datasets like melanoma detection, were calculated to evaluate the ability of the model to correctly classify malignant cases (true positives) and minimize false negatives. F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provided a balanced view of model performance, particularly for cases where misclassification could lead to severe consequences in clinical settings.

In addition to these metrics, Cohen’s Kappa statistic was employed to assess the level of agreement between the predicted and actual labels, accounting for the possibility of random chance. This metric is particularly valuable in medical image classification, where even small discrepancies can impact decision-making. Together, these metrics provided a holistic understanding of the model's effectiveness, enabling an objective comparison between raw and preprocessed datasets as well as among the five transfer learning architectures used in this study.
