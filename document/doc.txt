1. Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide, with melanoma being the deadliest subtype due to its aggressive nature and high metastasis potential. Early detection and classification of melanoma significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and patient survival. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have demonstrated the potential to enhance medical image analysis, offering robust solutions for automated disease detection.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the cornerstone for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies. Transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, has emerged as a prominent approach for medical imaging tasks, especially when labeled data is limited. This research focuses on building an automated system that compares the performance of various transfer learning models on raw and preprocessed melanoma skin cancer images to provide insights into optimal methodologies for clinical application.

2. Motivation
The detection and diagnosis of melanoma through dermoscopic images require specialized expertise, often unavailable in low-resource settings. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets or subtle visual variations.

Despite the success of CNN-based models, the choice of preprocessing techniques and model architecture can significantly influence the detection performance. Preprocessing methods, such as noise reduction, segmentation, and masking, aim to emphasize critical image features while suppressing irrelevant information. However, their impact on different transfer learning models is underexplored. By systematically comparing raw and preprocessed images across multiple pre-trained models, this research seeks to address the gap and provide a roadmap for optimizing melanoma detection workflows.

3. Problem Statement
Melanoma is a life-threatening condition that necessitates timely and accurate detection to reduce mortality rates. Current diagnostic techniques heavily rely on dermatologists, making them inaccessible in underdeveloped regions. While deep learning models have shown promise in automating diagnosis, there is a lack of standardized methodologies to compare and evaluate the performance of various transfer learning models on raw and preprocessed images.

The primary challenge lies in determining:
	1. The impact of preprocessing techniques on model performance.
	2. The suitability of different transfer learning models for melanoma classification.
	3. The comparative effectiveness of raw versus preprocessed images in improving detection accuracy.

This research addresses these challenges by performing a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art transfer learning models using raw and preprocessed images for melanoma detection.

Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset contains 10000 images. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. Dataset consists of 9600 images for training the model and 1000 images for evaluation of model.

4.2 Image Preprocessing
To evaluate the impact of preprocessing, two image sets are created:

	1. Raw Image Set: Original images without any preprocessing.
	2. Preprocessed Image Set: Images processed using the following techniques:
		- Resized to 256×256 pixels.

The study employs the following pre-trained models for transfer learning:
	1. VGG16
	2. MobileNet
	3. DenseNet
	4. ResNet50
	5. InceptionV3

Each model is fine-tuned on both raw and preprocessed image sets, with the final layers replaced to classify images into benign or malignant categories.

4.4 Model Training and Evaluation
For each image set, the models are trained using the same experimental setup:
	1. Data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
	2. Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss.
	3. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa.

Key insights into the impact of preprocessing and model architecture on melanoma detection accuracy are discussed.





The rapid advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the field of medical image analysis, offering highly accurate and automated solutions for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and anomaly detection. Melanoma detection relies on dermoscopic image analysis, a task characterized by complex patterns, subtle color variations, and irregular shapes. Traditional machine learning models struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their inability to process raw pixel data effectively.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a breakthrough in image classification. CNNs are particularly suited for spatial data due to their hierarchical feature extraction mechanism. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models, reducing the computational cost and the amount of labeled data required for training. Popular architectures like VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 provide a solid foundation for medical imaging tasks by extracting high-level features while preserving local spatial information.

Preprocessing techniques play a critical role in medical imaging, aiming to enhance the image quality and highlight relevant features. Techniques such as noise reduction, segmentation, and masking ensure that models focus on the lesion's characteristics rather than irrelevant background information. The integration of transfer learning with carefully preprocessed images can significantly improve melanoma detection accuracy.

The design methodology involves several systematic steps, each addressing a specific aspect of the melanoma detection process. Below, we outline these steps, their objectives, and the achieved outcomes.

Step 1: Dataset Preparation
Collected a publicly available melanoma dataset with dermoscopic images categorized into benign and malignant classes. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets. Also, ensured the availability of balanced and diverse data for model training, helps to reducing the risk of overfitting.

Step 2: Image Preprocessing
We applied preprocessing techniques to create two distinct image sets. We use original images without modification as raw image set. For the preprocessed image set, Images resized to 224×224, converted to grayscale, denoised using block-matching 3D filtering, segmented into binary lesion masks using maximum entropy thresholding, and enhanced using morphological operations.

The threshold 





Step 3: Model Selection
The selected five state-of-the-art transfer learning architectures: VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. Replaced the final layers of each model to adapt them for binary classification. We achieved the robust feature extraction capabilities of pre-trained models, enabling effective learning from a limited dataset. To enhance model we use eal-time data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustments and Increased the effective dataset size and introduced variability, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Step 4: Training and Fine-Tuning
The training and fine-tuning process for this research involved adapting pre-trained deep learning models — VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 for binary classification of melanoma images into benign and malignant categories. Each model's fully connected layers were replaced with a custom head consisting of a global average pooling layer, a dense layer with ReLU activation, and a final output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification. The models were trained separately on both raw and preprocessed image datasets to evaluate the impact of preprocessing on performance. The Adam optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 10−4, was used to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss. Early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure convergence.

During fine-tuning, the base layers of each model were partially unfrozen to allow the network to adapt pre-trained weights to the specific melanoma dataset while retaining the general features learned during initial training on large datasets such as ImageNet. Data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, zooms, and brightness adjustments were incorporated to increase the diversity of training samples, improving model robustness and generalization. The training process was monitored using validation accuracy and loss metrics, ensuring the selection of the best-performing model for final evaluation. This systematic approach to training and fine-tuning allowed for a comprehensive comparison of model architectures and preprocessing methods, highlighting the most effective strategies for melanoma detection.


Step: Model Evaluation
The evaluation of models in this study was conducted using a comprehensive set of metrics to ensure a robust assessment of their performance. Accuracy and loss were used as primary metrics during training and validation to monitor overall classification performance and the optimization process. Precision and recall, critical for imbalanced datasets like melanoma detection, were calculated to evaluate the ability of the model to correctly classify malignant cases (true positives) and minimize false negatives. F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provided a balanced view of model performance, particularly for cases where misclassification could lead to severe consequences in clinical settings.

In addition to these metrics, Cohen’s Kappa statistic was employed to assess the level of agreement between the predicted and actual labels, accounting for the possibility of random chance. This metric is particularly valuable in medical image classification, where even small discrepancies can impact decision-making. Together, these metrics provided a holistic understanding of the model's effectiveness, enabling an objective comparison between raw and preprocessed datasets as well as among the five transfer learning architectures used in this study.

#### INTRODUCTION

Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer worldwide, with melanoma being its most aggressive and life-threatening type. Unlike other forms of skin cancer, melanoma has a higher potential for metastasis, leading to severe health consequences if not detected early. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 300,000 new melanoma cases are diagnosed annually, with an increasing trend in incidence rates globally. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to improving survival rates; however, traditional diagnostic methods often rely on subjective interpretation by dermatologists, which can lead to variability in results.

Advancements in medical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced new paradigms in the detection and classification of skin cancer. Deep learning, a subset of AI, has emerged as a revolutionary technology, demonstrating exceptional performance in various image-based medical diagnostics. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized type of deep learning architecture, have shown particular promise in analyzing dermoscopic images for melanoma detection. By learning features directly from raw images, CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes.

Despite the progress in deep learning applications, several challenges persist in the domain of melanoma detection. The datasets used for training often exhibit variations in image quality, lighting, and skin tones further complicate the detection process. Addressing these challenges requires robust preprocessing techniques, augmentation strategies, and optimized model architectures to improve the generalizability and reliability of the detection system.

Another critical aspect is the interpretability of deep learning models in medical applications. Clinicians need to understand the basis of a model’s predictions to trust its recommendations. Techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) have been employed to provide visual explanations of model decisions, highlighting regions of interest in the dermoscopic images. Such interpretability not only increases the acceptance of AI-based tools in clinical settings but also enhances the collaboration between clinicians and AI systems.

### Proposed Methodology

The proposed methodology leverages advanced deep learning techniques for the early detection and classification of melanoma skin cancer. It integrates data preprocessing, model selection, parameter tuning, and comprehensive performance evaluation to achieve optimal results. A combination of transfer learning and ensemble modeling is employed to enhance the system's robustness and accuracy. The methodology is structured to address challenges like class imbalance, variability in dermoscopic images, and the need for interpretability, ensuring clinical applicability.

The dataset used for this study consists of labeled dermoscopic images, sourced from public datasets like ISIC 2020 or HAM10000. These datasets contain images of melanoma and benign lesions, along with metadata such as lesion location and patient age. Data preprocessing includes resizing images to 224x224 pixels, normalizing pixel values to a range of 0-1, and applying augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase diversity. Class imbalance is addressed through weighted loss functions or techniques like SMOTE, ensuring the model is not biased toward the majority class.

The project workflow begins with data acquisition, followed by preprocessing to standardize the dataset. Pre-trained CNN architectures like ResNet50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet are selected for feature extraction and classification. These models are fine-tuned to adapt to the specific requirements of melanoma detection. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing subsets to facilitate model development and evaluation. An ensemble technique aggregates predictions from top-performing models to enhance overall accuracy and reduce model-specific biases.

Model training involves freezing the initial layers of pre-trained architectures to retain general features while fine-tuning later layers for task-specific learning. The categorical cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer are used to train the models. Early stopping prevents overfitting by halting training when validation performance ceases to improve. Testing evaluates the trained models on unseen data, analyzing their classification accuracy and robustness. The ensemble approach combines the strengths of individual models, delivering a more reliable prediction system.

Hyperparameter tuning is critical for optimizing model performance. Techniques such as grid search and random search are employed to find the best combination of parameters, including learning rate, batch size, dropout rates, and the number of fine-tuned layers. A learning rate scheduler dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training to improve convergence. These strategies ensure that the models achieve the best possible performance without overfitting or underfitting.

The evaluation of the proposed system involves metrics like accuracy, cross-entropy loss, Cohen's kappa, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, while loss quantifies the model's performance during training. Cohen's kappa accounts for random agreement, and the precision-recall-F1 trio provides a balanced assessment, particularly for imbalanced datasets. Confusion matrices offer detailed insights into classification performance, highlighting areas for improvement.

Comparison and validation are conducted to benchmark the proposed system against existing methods. Performance metrics from pre-trained models are compared with the ensemble model to demonstrate its superiority. k-fold cross-validation ensures that the results are generalizable and not influenced by specific data splits. The ensemble model consistently outperforms individual models, confirming its effectiveness in improving robustness and accuracy.

This methodology provides a structured approach for developing a reliable, interpretable, and clinically applicable system for melanoma detection. By integrating preprocessing, transfer learning, ensemble techniques, and rigorous evaluation metrics, the proposed system addresses key challenges in skin cancer diagnosis. Its robust performance and interpretability make it a valuable tool for assisting clinicians in early melanoma detection.

The comprehensive nature of the methodology ensures that the proposed system is not only effective but also adaptable to different clinical settings and datasets. Future work may include real-world deployment and further enhancements to accommodate a wider variety of skin conditions, broadening its applicability in dermatological care.

The proposed research focuses on developing an advanced deep learning-based system for the early detection and classification of melanoma skin cancer. Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, requires prompt and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. This study aims to address critical challenges in melanoma detection, including variability in dermoscopic images, image preprocessing, and the need for reliable interpretability. By leveraging state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques, the methodology aims to create a robust and clinically applicable diagnostic tool. The system incorporates preprocessing steps, optimized model architectures, and advanced evaluation metrics to ensure high performance and generalizability across diverse datasets.

The approach begins with data preprocessing, where dermoscopic images are Resized to 224×224 pixels, Converted to grayscale version of the image, Noise reduction using block-matching 3D (BM3D) filtering, Binary mass lesion image and Binary lesion mask formed by thresholding, Segmentation using binary lesion masks and morphological operations, Generation of masked ROI showing only the masked area of the image and inverse-masked images showing everything except the masked area, Canny edge-detected image to enhance model training.

Transfer learning based pre-trained architectures require input images of a fixed size. Resizing all images to 224x224 pixels ensures uniformity in input dimensions, which is crucial for batch processing during training and inference. This step also reduces computational complexity by downsizing high-resolution images while retaining essential features.

FORMULA


Dermoscopic images are often in RGB format, containing redundant color information. For melanoma detection, intensity variations and texture patterns are more significant than color. Converting RGB images to grayscale reduces the data to a single channel, retaining only the luminance (intensity) values. This simplifies the model's input without compromising the essential information required for lesion analysis.

FORMULA


These preprocessing steps significantly enhance model training by ensuring uniformity, efficiency, and improved generalization. Resizing images to a consistent size provides uniform input dimensions, facilitating smooth batch processing and reducing variance caused by varying image sizes. The conversion to grayscale simplifies the feature space by reducing the complexity of input data while retaining critical information necessary for lesion detection. Together, these steps optimize the dataset for deep learning by minimizing memory requirements and speeding up computations. Moreover, standardized and simplified inputs enable the model to concentrate on meaningful patterns, improving its ability to generalize effectively to unseen data and enhancing overall performance.

Block-Matching 3D (BM3D) filtering is a state-of-the-art technique for noise reduction that enhances image quality by grouping similar image patches into 3D blocks and collaboratively filtering them. This method operates in two stages: basic and final denoising. In the basic step, noisy patches are grouped based on similarity and transformed using a 3D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Thresholding is applied to suppress noise, and the inverse transform reconstructs denoised patches. In the final step, further refinement is performed by aggregating information from overlapping blocks.

FORMULA


BM3D filtering is crucial for enhancing model training by removing noise while preserving essential image structures, such as lesion boundaries. This denoising ensures that the input images are free from random variations or artifacts that could mislead the model. By focusing on clean, high-quality features, BM3D filtering improves the model's ability to identify patterns relevant to melanoma detection, such as texture and shape. Additionally, the reduced noise results in more consistent feature representations, enabling better learning, faster convergence, and improved generalization on unseen data.

Binary mass lesion images and lesion masks are created by thresholding the original image to distinguish the lesion area from the background. The thresholding process converts grayscale pixel values into binary values (0 or 1) based on a set threshold. If a pixel's intensity exceeds the threshold, it is considered part of the lesion (foreground), and if it is below the threshold, it is part of the background. This results in a binary mass lesion image that highlights the lesion area, while the binary lesion mask serves as a template for extracting or focusing on the lesion in subsequent processing steps. The process can be mathematically expressed as:

FORMULA


The creation of binary mass lesion images and lesion masks enhances model training by simplifying the input data, isolating the lesion from the surrounding skin. This focused region of interest (ROI) reduces the model's need to process irrelevant background information, enabling it to learn more effectively from the lesion's structural and textural features. By reducing complexity and emphasizing the target areas, these binary images improve segmentation accuracy and help the model learn relevant patterns more efficiently. This leads to better generalization, faster convergence during training, and improved performance in detecting melanoma.

Segmentation using binary lesion masks involves isolating the region of interest (ROI) the lesion area from the rest of the image using a binary mask. The binary lesion mask highlights the lesion in white (value 1) and the background in black (value 0). Morphological operations, such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing, are applied to refine the segmentation by removing small noise or filling gaps in the lesion area. These operations use a structuring element to manipulate the binary image and improve the quality of the segmented lesion. The dilation and erosion formulas for morphological operations are as follows:

FORMULA


Segmentation with binary lesion masks and morphological operations enhances model training by ensuring that only the lesion area is considered for further analysis, eliminating any irrelevant background information. This precise segmentation allows the model to focus on critical features, such as shape, texture, and boundaries of the lesion, improving its ability to distinguish between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions. The morphological operations help refine the mask, removing small artifacts and inconsistencies that could confuse the model. By providing cleaner, more accurate input data, the model can learn more effectively, leading to improved segmentation performance and better overall accuracy in melanoma detection.

The generation of masked Region of Interest (ROI) and inverse-masked images involves applying the binary lesion mask to isolate and highlight the lesion area, as well as to create an inverse mask that removes the lesion. The masked ROI keeps only the lesion area and sets all non-lesion regions to black (value 0). The inverse-masked image, on the other hand, keeps the non-lesion areas and sets the lesion region to black. The formula for masking and inverse-masking can be expressed as:

FORMULA


The generation of masked ROI and inverse-masked images enhances model training by providing two types of data: one focused solely on the lesion area (masked ROI) and the other on the surrounding background (inverse-masked image). This dual approach helps the model learn to recognize both the presence of the lesion and distinguish it from the background. The isolated lesion in the masked ROI allows the model to focus on the relevant features, improving classification accuracy. In contrast, the inverse-masked image can be used to emphasize background features, improving the model’s ability to differentiate between the lesion and non-lesion regions, ultimately leading to more accurate and robust melanoma detection.

The Canny edge detection algorithm is used to highlight the edges within an image, which is particularly useful for identifying the boundaries of lesions. The algorithm works by applying a series of steps: blurring the image with a Gaussian filter to reduce noise, calculating the gradient magnitude and direction to detect edges, applying non-maximum suppression to thin the edges, and finally performing edge tracking by hysteresis to retain strong edges and discard weak ones. The mathematical representation of the gradient magnitude is:

FORMULA


Canny edge detection enhances model training by emphasizing the boundaries of the lesions, which are often critical for accurate classification. By focusing on edge features, the model can better differentiate between lesion and non-lesion areas, especially in cases where texture or intensity differences are subtle. This pre-processing step helps the model learn key structural features, such as the shape and contours of melanoma lesions, improving its ability to make accurate predictions. Additionally, edge-detection reduces the complexity of the image by focusing on significant features, thus enabling the model to more effectively identify and classify lesions.


Pre-trained transfer learning networks such as VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 are fine-tuned for melanoma classification, allowing the system to leverage the feature extraction capabilities of these architectures. An ensemble modeling technique aggregates predictions from multiple models to improve robustness and accuracy. The proposed methodology also integrates advanced evaluation metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, Cohen’s kappa, and confusion matrices, to comprehensively assess the system's performance. This holistic approach ensures that the proposed system is not only accurate but also interpretable, providing clinicians with visual cues through Grad-CAM heatmaps to build trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.

After prepares the important features like lesion boundaries and ROI are extracted. The data moves to Model Selection and Training, where transfer learning models like VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 are fine-tuned for melanoma classification, and trained using the raw and pre-processed images. 


Once the image pre-processing prepares the dataset by enhancing and isolating important features, such as lesion boundaries and the region of interest (ROI), the next step involves Model Selection and Training. Here, advanced transfer learning models, including VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, are used for melanoma classification. These pre-trained models are fine-tuned to adapt to the specific characteristics of the melanoma dataset. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the pre-trained models weights to learn domain-specific features while retaining generalizable patterns learned during pre-training. Both raw and pre-processed images are used to train these models, allowing the comparison of performance between datasets as shown in Fig.. This approach leverages the models powerful feature extraction capabilities, ensuring accurate detection and classification of melanoma lesions by focusing on structural, textural, and boundary details essential for distinguishing between malignant and benign cases.



The evaluation of transfer learning models was conducted using both raw and pre-processed datasets, focusing on metrics like accuracy, loss, Cohen’s kappa, precision, recall, and F1-score. From the raw dataset, DenseNet achieved the highest accuracy (90.98%), followed closely by MobileNet (89.31%). However, when utilizing the pre-processed dataset, all models showed a significant improvement in performance. MobileNet emerged as the best-performing model with the pre-processed dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91.95%, the lowest loss of 8.05%, and the highest Cohen's kappa score of 83.86%. This indicates superior agreement between predicted and actual classifications. Additionally, MobileNet attained precision, recall, and F1 scores of 92, highlighting its robustness in melanoma classification. The consistent improvement across all metrics demonstrates that pre-processing enhances the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns, with MobileNet proving to be the most reliable and effective model for the given task.

The comparison between raw and pre-processed datasets revealed the critical role of pre-processing in enhancing model efficacy. While DenseNet showed strong performance on the raw dataset with an accuracy of 90.98%, MobileNet surpassed it with pre-processed data, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging edge detection, lesion segmentation, and ROI masking for feature enhancement. These steps reduced noise and background distractions, enabling the models to focus on relevant lesion features. The improved metrics also validated the hypothesis that carefully curated and pre-processed data can significantly enhance model generalization and predictive capabilities.

To deploy the trained models, Streamlit was utilized to create a user-friendly application for real-time melanoma detection. The application enables users to upload dermoscopic images, which are immediately pre-processed using the established pipeline. MobileNet, as the best-performing model, is then used to classify the lesions as benign or malignant. The deployment not only provides predictions but also includes detailed visualizations of the pre-processed images, such as masked ROI and edge-detected versions. This functionality helps clinicians and researchers better understand the features influencing the model’s predictions.

The deployment using Streamlit ensures that the solution is both accessible and scalable, making it suitable for integration into clinical workflows. Its lightweight architecture supports deployment on cloud platforms, allowing for widespread use without the need for complex infrastructure. The combination of cutting-edge machine learning techniques and an intuitive interface demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare, offering a reliable and efficient tool for early melanoma detection and diagnosis. This seamless transition from research to application underscores the practical significance of the study, bridging the gap between computational advancements and real-world medical challenges.

5. CONCLUSION

This study presented a comprehensive approach to melanoma skin cancer detection using advanced transfer learning models combined with a robust data pre-processing. By enhancing the dataset through methods such as resizing, grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and lesion masking, the models achieved improved performance, with MobileNet emerging as the most effective model. It achieved the highest accuracy of 91.95% and demonstrated superior generalization across all evaluation metrics. The integration of these techniques highlights the importance of data preparation and model selection in achieving reliable and accurate diagnostic systems for critical healthcare applications. Furthermore, the deployment of the trained model using Streamlit showcased its practical usability, providing a user-friendly, real-time detection tool for clinicians and researchers.  

The proposed framework lays the foundation for further advancements in AI-driven melanoma detection systems. Future work could explore the integration of larger and more diverse datasets to improve model robustness and generalizability across various demographic and clinical conditions. Additionally, incorporating multi-modal data, such as patient history and genetic information, could enhance the system's diagnostic accuracy. The development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide insights into the model’s decision-making process would further increase its trustworthiness in clinical settings. Finally, extending the deployment to mobile and cloud-based platforms can make this technology accessible to remote and underserved regions, amplifying its impact on global healthcare challenges.
