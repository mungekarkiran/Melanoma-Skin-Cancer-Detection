# **Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection**
Melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer, poses significant health risks due to its high mortality rate if undetected at an early stage. The advancement in deep learning offers promising opportunities for automating melanoma detection and classification, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This project focuses on building a robust diagnostic framework leveraging dermoscopic image data.

The proposed system incorporates for preprocessing, segmentation, and classification to ensure optimal input quality and reliable predictions. Multiple deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), transfer learning models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet), and hybrid approaches, are explored to determine the best-performing model. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate these models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency. The comparative study highlights the trade-offs between model complexity and diagnostic accuracy, providing insights into selecting the most suitable approach for clinical applications.

Preliminary results demonstrate that certain transfer learning models achieve superior performance, emphasizing the importance of leveraging pre-trained architectures for medical imaging tasks. The developed system has potential applications in real-world clinical environments, offering healthcare professionals an AI-powered tool for early melanoma detection and reducing diagnostic burdens.
