# **Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for the early detection and classification of melanoma skin cancer. The system processes dermoscopic images, leverages state-of-the-art models, and enables comparative performance analysis. The repository is organized into modular folders for seamless development, research, and deployment.
